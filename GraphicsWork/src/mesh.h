PURPOSE      : Main container for geometric data. The vertex is the smallest unit of geometric data.
               This class is tasked with creating the OpenGL representation of the loaded data.
SPECIAL NOTES: Specific primitive meshes are defined in the meshprimitives.h file. Currently, the mesh
               also acts as a container for the texture indices of hte screen. This is limiting
               since it forces all meshes to have a similar texture representation. This shall be
               adressed with a re-write of the mesh/model system that shall introduce a material
               class that will take care of the textures and shaders used in the mesh. High priority.
